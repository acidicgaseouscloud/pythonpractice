    "The bag-of-words ([BOW](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model)) table will contain a count for each text and every word.\n",
    "\n",
    "All letters are converted to lower case and we filter the words until we only have words with two or more alphanumeric characters (no punctuation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Important parameters are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  ``max_features`` limits the model to consider only the top *n* most frequent words. More is often better but may be slow to compute.\n",
    "- ``min_df`` and ``max_df`` restrict the words to those that occur in a certain proportion of texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, setting these to the values 0.2 and 0.8, respectively, restricts the model to words that are in at least 20%, and at most 80% of the texts. This removes rare words on the one hand, and ignores highly frequent words such as [function words](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_word) on the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``use_idf=True`` turns on [tf-idf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) weighting; this incorporates not only the total frequency of a word, but also the number of texts in which it appears. This means that words which are frequent in one text but not in others will get a high score, while words that are frequent in all documents receive a lower score.\n",
    "- ``sublinear_tf=True`` is another variation which makes the word frequencies logarithmic.\n",
    "- ``ngram_range``: selects the number of words in each feature; the default of ``(1, 1)`` selects individual words, which is most efficient. Higher numbers result in more informative features, but also requires a lot more memory. Bigrams, i.e., ``ngram_range=(2, 2)`` is a good trade-off and yields features with 2 consecutive words such as ``the man`` and ``man walks`` etc."
