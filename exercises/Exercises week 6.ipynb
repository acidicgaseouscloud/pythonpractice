      "speak , seemed to feel all the tenderness of this behaviour , and after some time thus spent in joint affliction , she put all the letters into elinor 's hands ; and then covering her face with her handkerchief , almost screamed with agony . elinor , who knew that such grief , shocking as it was to witness it , must have its course , watched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat spent itself , and then turning eagerly to willoughby 's letter , read as follows : `` bond street , january . `` my dear madam , `` i have just had the honour of receiving your letter , for which i beg to return my sincere acknowledgments . i am much concerned to find there was anything in my behaviour last night that did not meet your approbation ; and though i am quite at a loss to discover in what point i could be so unfortunate as to offend you , i entreat your forgiveness of what i can assure you to have been perfectly unintentional . i shall never reflect on my former acquaintance with your family in devonshire without the most grateful pleasure , and flatter myself it will not be broken by any mistake or misapprehension of my actions . my esteem for your whole family is very sincere ; but if i have been so unfortunate as to give rise to a belief of more than i felt , or meant to express , i shall reproach myself for not having been more guarded in my professions of that esteem . that i should ever have meant more you will allow to be impossible , when you understand that my affections have been long engaged elsewhere , and it will not be many weeks , i believe , before this engagement is fulfilled . it is with great regret that i obey your commands in returning the letters with which i have been honoured from you , and the lock of hair , which you so obligingly bestowed on me . `` i am , dear madam , `` your most obedient `` humble servant , `` john willoughby . '' with what indignation such a letter as this must be read by miss dashwood , may be imagined . though aware , before she began it , that it must bring a confession of his inconstancy , and confirm their separation for ever , she was not aware that such language could be suffered to announce it ; nor could she have supposed willoughby capable of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable and delicate feeling -- so far from the common decorum of a gentleman , as to send a letter so impudently cruel : a letter which , instead of bringing with his desire of a release any professions of regret , acknowledged no breach of faith , denied all peculiar affection whatever -- a letter of which every line was an insult , and which proclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy . she paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment ; then read it again and again ; but every perusal only served to increase her abhorrence of the man , and so bitter were her feelings against him , that she dared not trust herself to speak , lest she might wound marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement , not as a loss to her of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and most irremediable of all evils , a connection , for life , with an unprincipled man , as a deliverance the most real , a blessing the most important . in her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter , on the depravity of that mind which could dictate it , and probably , on the very different mind of a very different person , who had no other connection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with every thing that passed , elinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister , forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread , and so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room , that when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door , she went to the window to see who could be coming so unreasonably early , she was all astonishment to perceive mrs. jennings 's chariot , which she knew had not been ordered till one . determined not to quit marianne , though hopeless of contributing , at present , to her ease , she hurried away to excuse herself from attending mrs. jennings , on account of her sister being indisposed . mrs. jennings , with a thoroughly good-humoured concern for its cause , admitted the excuse most readily , and elinor , after seeing her safe off , returned to marianne , whom she found attempting to rise from the bed , and whom she reached just in time to prevent her from falling on the floor , faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest and food ; for it was many days since she had any appetite , and many nights since she had really slept ; and now , when her mind was no longer supported by the fever of suspense , the consequence of all this was felt in an aching head , a weakened stomach , and a general nervous faintness . a glass of wine , which elinor procured for her directly , made her more comfortable , and she was at last able to express some sense of her kindness , by saying , '' poor elinor ! how unhappy i make you ! '' `` i only wish , '' replied her sister , `` there were any thing i could do , which might be of comfort to you . '' this , as every thing else would have been , was too much for marianne , who could only exclaim , in the anguish of her heart , `` oh ! elinor , i am miserable , indeed , '' before her voice was entirely lost in sobs . elinor could no longer witness this torrent of unresisted grief in silence . `` exert yourself , dear marianne , '' she cried , '' if you would not kill yourself and all who love you . think of your mother ; think of her misery while you suffer : for her sake you must exert yourself . '' `` i can not , i can not , '' cried marianne ; `` leave me , leave me , if i distress you ; leave me , hate me , forget me ! but do not torture me so . oh ! how easy for those , who have no sorrow of their own to talk of exertion ! happy , happy elinor , you can not have an idea of what i suffer . '' `` do you call me happy , marianne ? ah ! if you knew ! -- and can you believe me to be so , while i see you so wretched ! '' `` forgive me , forgive me , '' throwing her arms round her sister 's neck ; `` i know you feel for me ; i know what a heart you have ; but yet you are -- you must be happy ; edward loves you -- what , oh what , can do away such happiness as that ? '' `` many , many circumstances , '' said elinor , solemnly . `` no , no , no , '' cried marianne wildly , `` he loves you , and only you . you can have no grief . '' `` i can have no pleasure while i see you in this state . '' `` and you will never see me otherwise . mine is a misery which nothing can do away . '' `` you must not talk so , marianne . have you no comforts ? no friends ? is your loss such as leaves no opening for consolation ? much as you suffer now , think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of his character had been delayed to a later period -- if your engagement had been carried on for months and months , as it might have been , before he chose to put an end to it . every additional day of unhappy confidence , on your side , would have made the blow more dreadful . '' `` engagement ! '' cried marianne , `` there has been no engagement . '' `` no engagement ! '' `` no , he is not so unworthy as you believe him . he has broken no faith with me . '' `` but he told you that he loved you . '' `` yes -- no -- never absolutely . it was every day implied , but never professedly declared . sometimes i thought it had been -- but it never was . '' `` yet you wrote to him ? '' -- '' yes -- could that be wrong after all that had passed ? -- but i can not talk . '' elinor said no more , and turning again to the three letters which now raised a much stronger curiosity than before , directly ran over the contents of all . the first , which was what her sister had sent him on their arrival in town , was to this effect . berkeley street , january . `` how surprised you will be , willoughby , on receiving this ; and i think you will feel something more than surprise , when you know that i am in town . an opportunity of coming hither , though with mrs. jennings , was a temptation we could not resist . i wish you may receive this in time to come here to-night , but i will not depend on it . at any rate i shall expect you to-morrow . for the present , adieu . `` m.d . '' her second note , which had been written on the morning after the dance at the middletons ' , was in these words : -- `` i can not express my disappointment in having missed you the day before yesterday , nor my astonishment at not having received any answer to a note which i sent you above a week ago . i have been expecting to hear from you , and still more to see you , every hour of the day . pray call again as soon as possible , and explain the reason of my having expected this in vain . you had better come earlier another time , because we are generally out by one . we were last night at lady middleton 's , where there was a dance . i have been told that you were asked to be of the party . but could it be so ? you must be very much altered indeed since we parted , if that could be the case , and you not there . but i will not suppose this possible , and i hope very soon to receive your personal assurance of its being otherwise . `` m.d . '' the contents of her last note to him were these : -- `` what am i to imagine , willoughby , by your behaviour last night ? again i demand an explanation of it . i was prepared to meet you with the pleasure which our separation naturally produced , with the familiarity which our intimacy at barton appeared to me to justify . i was repulsed indeed ! i have passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse a conduct which can scarcely be called less than insulting ; but though i have not yet been able to form any reasonable apology for your behaviour , i am perfectly ready to hear your justification of it . you have perhaps been misinformed , or purposely deceived , in something concerning me , which may have lowered me in your opinion . tell me what it is , explain the grounds on which you acted , and i shall be satisfied , in being able to satisfy you . it would grieve me indeed to be obliged to think ill of you ; but if i am to do it , if i am to learn that you are not what we have hitherto believed you , that your regard for us all was insincere , that your behaviour to me was intended only to deceive , let it be told as soon as possible . my feelings are at present in a state of dreadful indecision ; i wish to acquit you , but certainty on either side will be ease to what i now suffer . if your sentiments are no longer what they were , you will return my notes , and the lock of my hair which is in your possession . `` m.d . '' that such letters , so full of affection and confidence , could have been so answered , elinor , for willoughby 's sake , would have been unwilling to believe . but her condemnation of him did not blind her to the impropriety of their having been written at all ; and she was silently grieving over the imprudence which had hazarded such unsolicited proofs of tenderness , not warranted by anything preceding , and most severely condemned by the event , when marianne , perceiving that she had finished the letters , observed to her that they contained nothing but what any one would have written in the same situation . `` i felt myself , '' she added , `` to be as solemnly engaged to him , as if the strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other . '' `` i can believe it , '' said elinor ; `` but unfortunately he did not feel the same . '' `` he did feel the same , elinor -- for weeks and weeks he felt it . i know he did . whatever may have changed him now , ( and nothing but the blackest art employed against me can have done it ) , i was once as dear to him as my own soul could wish . this lock of hair , which now he can so readily give up , was begged of me with the most earnest supplication . had you seen his look , his manner , had you heard his voice at that moment ! have you forgot the last evening of our being together at barton ? the morning that we parted too ! when he told me that it might be many weeks before we met again -- his distress -- can i ever forget his distress ? '' for a moment or two she could say no more ; but when this emotion had passed away , she added , in a firmer tone , '' elinor , i have been cruelly used ; but not by willoughby . '' `` dearest marianne , who but himself ? by whom can he have been instigated ? '' `` by all the world , rather than by his own heart . i could rather believe every creature of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin me in his opinion , than believe his nature capable of such cruelty . this woman of whom he writes -- whoever she be -- or any one , in short , but your own dear self , mama , and edward , may have been so barbarous to bely me . beyond you three , is there a creature in the world whom i would not rather suspect of evil than willoughby , whose heart i know so well ? '' elinor would not contend , and only replied , '' whoever may have been so detestably your enemy , let them be cheated of their malignant triumph , my dear sister , by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own innocence and good intentions supports your spirits . it is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence . '' `` no , no , '' cried marianne , `` misery such as mine has no pride . i care not who knows that i am wretched . the triumph of seeing me so may be open to all the world . elinor , elinor , they who suffer little may be proud and independent as they like -- may resist insult , or return mortification -- but i can not . i must feel -- i must be wretched -- and they are welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can . '' `` but for my mother 's sake and mine -- '' '' i would do more than for my own . but to appear happy when i am so miserable -- oh ! who can require it ? '' again they were both silent . elinor was employed in walking thoughtfully from the fire to the window , from the window to the fire , without knowing that she received warmth from one , or discerning objects through the other ; and marianne , seated at the foot of the bed , with her head leaning against one of its posts , again took up willoughby 's letter , and , after shuddering over every sentence , exclaimed -- '' it is too much ! oh , willoughby , willoughby , could this be yours ! cruel , cruel -- nothing can acquit you . elinor , nothing can . whatever he might have heard against me -- ought he not to have suspended his belief ? ought he not to have told me of it , to have given me the power of clearing myself ? 'the lock of hair , ( repeating it from the letter , ) which you so obligingly bestowed on me ' -- that is unpardonable . willoughby , where was your heart when you wrote those words ? oh , barbarously insolent ! -- elinor , can he be justified ? '' `` no , marianne , in no possible way . '' `` and yet this woman -- who knows what her art may have been ? -- how long it may have been premeditated , and how deeply contrived by her ! -- who is she ? -- who can she be ? -- whom did i ever hear him talk of as young and attractive among his female acquaintance ? -- oh ! no one , no one -- he talked to me only of myself . '' another pause ensued ; marianne was greatly agitated , and it ended thus . `` elinor , i must go home . i must go and comfort mama . can not we be gone to-morrow ? '' `` to-morrow , marianne ! '' `` yes , why should i stay here ? i came only for willoughby 's sake -- and now who cares for me ? who regards me ? '' `` it would be impossible to go to-morrow . we owe mrs. jennings much more than civility ; and civility of the commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal as that . '' `` well then , another day or two , perhaps ; but i can not stay here long , i can not stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people . the middletons and palmers -- how am i to bear their pity ? the pity of such a woman as lady middleton ! oh , what would he say to that ! '' elinor advised her to lie down again , and for a moment she did so ; but no attitude could give her ease ; and in restless pain of mind and body she moved from one posture to another , till growing more and more hysterical , her sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at all , and for some time was fearful of being constrained to call for assistance . some lavender drops , however , which she was at length persuaded to take , were of use ; and from that time till mrs. jennings returned , she continued on the bed quiet and motionless . chapter 30 mrs. jennings came immediately to their room on her return , and without waiting to have her request of admittance answered , opened the door and walked in with a look of real concern . `` how do you do my dear ? '' -- said she in a voice of great compassion to marianne , who turned away her face without attempting to answer . `` how is she , miss dashwood ? -- poor thing ! she looks very bad. -- no wonder . ay , it is but too true . he is to be married very soon -- a good-for-nothing fellow ! i have no patience with him . mrs. taylor told me of it half an hour ago , and she was told it by a particular friend of miss grey herself , else i am sure i should not have believed it ; and i was almost ready to sink as it was . well , said i , all i can say is , that if this be true , he has used a young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill , and i wish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out . and so i shall always say , my dear , you may depend on it . i have no notion of men 's going on in this way ; and if ever i meet him again , i will give him such a dressing as he has not had this many a day . but there is one comfort , my dear miss marianne ; he is not the only young man in the world worth having ; and with your pretty face you will never want admirers . well , poor thing ! i won't disturb her any longer , for she had better have her cry out at once and have done with . the parrys and sandersons luckily are coming tonight you know , and that will amuse her . '' she then went away , walking on tiptoe out of the room , as if she supposed her young friend 's affliction could be increased by noise . marianne , to the surprise of her sister , determined on dining with them . elinor even advised her against it . but `` no , she would go down ; she could bear it very well , and the bustle about her would be less . '' elinor , pleased to have her governed for a moment by such a motive , though believing it hardly possible that she could sit out the dinner , said no more ; and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could , while marianne still remained on the bed , was ready to assist her into the dining room as soon as they were summoned to it . when there , though looking most wretchedly , she ate more and was calmer than her sister had expected . had she tried to speak , or had she been conscious of half mrs. jennings 's well-meant but ill-judged attentions to her , this calmness could not have been maintained ; but not a syllable escaped her lips ; and the abstraction of her thoughts preserved her in ignorance of every thing that was passing before her . elinor , who did justice to mrs. jennings 's kindness , though its effusions were often distressing , and sometimes almost ridiculous , made her those acknowledgments , and returned her those civilities , which her sister could not make or return for herself . their good friend saw that marianne was unhappy , and felt that every thing was due to her which might make her at all less so . she treated her therefore , with all the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a favourite child on the last day of its holidays . marianne was to have the best place by the fire , was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house , and to be amused by the relation of all the news of the day . had not elinor , in the sad countenance of her sister , seen a check to all mirth , she could have been entertained by mrs. jennings 's endeavours to cure a disappointment in love , by a variety of sweetmeats and olives , and a good fire . as soon , however , as the consciousness of all this was forced by continual repetition on marianne , she could stay no longer . with a hasty exclamation of misery , and a sign to her sister not to follow her , she directly got up and hurried out of the room . `` poor soul ! '' cried mrs. jennings , as soon as she was gone , '' how it grieves me to see her ! and i declare if she is not gone away without finishing her wine ! and the dried cherries too ! lord ! nothing seems to do her any good . i am sure if i knew of any thing she would like , i would send all over the town for it . well , it is the oddest thing to me , that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill ! but when there is plenty of money on one side , and next to none on the other , lord bless you ! they care no more about such things ! -- '' '' the lady then -- miss grey i think you called her -- is very rich ? '' `` fifty thousand pounds , my dear . did you ever see her ? a smart , stylish girl they say , but not handsome . i remember her aunt very well , biddy henshawe ; she married a very wealthy man . but the family are all rich together . fifty thousand pounds ! and by all accounts , it wo n't come before it 's wanted ; for they say he is all to pieces . no wonder ! dashing about with his curricle and hunters ! well , it do n't signify talking ; but when a young man , be who he will , comes and makes love to a pretty girl , and promises marriage , he has no business to fly off from his word only because he grows poor , and a richer girl is ready to have him . why do n't he , in such a case , sell his horses , let his house , turn off his servants , and make a thorough reform at once ? i warrant you , miss marianne would have been ready to wait till matters came round . but that wo n't do now-a-days ; nothing in the way of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age . '' `` do you know what kind of a girl miss grey is ? is she said to be amiable ? '' `` i never heard any harm of her ; indeed i hardly ever heard her mentioned ; except that mrs. taylor did say this morning , that one day miss walker hinted to her , that she believed mr. and mrs. ellison would not be sorry to have miss grey married , for she and mrs. ellison could never agree . '' -- '' and who are the ellisons ? '' `` her guardians , my dear . but now she is of age and may choose for herself ; and a pretty choice she has made ! -- what now , '' after pausing a moment -- '' your poor sister is gone to her own room , i suppose , to moan by herself . is there nothing one can get to comfort her ? poor dear , it seems quite cruel to let her be alone . well , by-and-by we shall have a few friends , and that will amuse her a little . what shall we play at ? she hates whist i know ; but is there no round game she cares for ? '' `` dear ma'am , this kindness is quite unnecessary . marianne , i dare say , will not leave her room again this evening . i shall persuade her if i can to go early to bed , for i am sure she wants rest . '' `` aye , i believe that will be best for her . let her name her own supper , and go to bed . lord ! no wonder she has been looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two , for this matter i suppose has been hanging over her head as long as that . and so the letter that came today finished it ! poor soul ! i am sure if i had had a notion of it , i would not have joked her about it for all my money . but then you know , how should i guess such a thing ? i made sure of its being nothing but a common love letter , and you know young people like to be laughed at about them . lord ! how concerned sir john and my daughters will be when they hear it ! if i had my senses about me i might have called in conduit street in my way home , and told them of it . but i shall see them tomorrow . '' `` it would be unnecessary i am sure , for you to caution mrs. palmer and sir john against ever naming mr. willoughby , or making the slightest allusion to what has passed , before my sister . their own good-nature must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing about it when she is present ; and the less that may ever be said to myself on the subject , the more my feelings will be spared , as you my dear madam will easily believe . '' `` oh ! lord ! yes , that i do indeed . it must be terrible for you to hear it talked of ; and as for your sister , i am sure i would not mention a word about it to her for the world . you saw i did not all dinner time . no more would sir john , nor my daughters , for they are all very thoughtful and considerate ; especially if i give them a hint , as i certainly will . for my part , i think the less that is said about such things , the better , the sooner 't is blown over and forgot . and what does talking ever do you know ? '' `` in this affair it can only do harm ; more so perhaps than in many cases of a similar kind , for it has been attended by circumstances which , for the sake of every one concerned in it , make it unfit to become the public conversation . i must do this justice to mr. willoughby -- he has broken no positive engagement with my sister . '' `` law , my dear ! do n't pretend to defend him . no positive engagement indeed ! after taking her all over allenham house , and fixing on the very rooms they were to live in hereafter ! '' elinor , for her sister 's sake , could not press the subject farther , and she hoped it was not required of her for willoughby 's ; since , though marianne might lose much , he could gain very little by the enforcement of the real truth . after a short silence on both sides , mrs. jennings , with all her natural hilarity , burst forth again . `` well , my dear , 't is a true saying about an ill-wind , for it will be all the better for colonel brandon . he will have her at last ; aye , that he will . mind me , now , if they a n't married by mid-summer . lord ! how he'll chuckle over this news ! i hope he will come tonight . it will be all to one a better match for your sister . two thousand a year without debt or drawback -- except the little love-child , indeed ; aye , i had forgot her ; but she may be 'prenticed out at a small cost , and then what does it signify ? delaford is a nice place , i can tell you ; exactly what i call a nice old fashioned place , full of comforts and conveniences ; quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered with the best fruit-trees in the country ; and such a mulberry tree in one corner ! lord ! how charlotte and i did stuff the only time we were there ! then , there is a dove-cote , some delightful stew-ponds , and a very pretty canal ; and every thing , in short , that one could wish for ; and , moreover , it is close to the church , and only a quarter of a mile from the turnpike-road , so 't is never dull , for if you only go and sit up in an old yew arbour behind the house , you may see all the carriages that pass along . oh ! 't is a nice place ! a butcher hard by in the village , and the parsonage-house within a stone 's throw . to my fancy , a thousand times prettier than barton park , where they are forced to send three miles for their meat , and have not a neighbour nearer than your mother . well , i shall spirit up the colonel as soon as i can . one shoulder of mutton , you know , drives another down . if we can but put willoughby out of her head ! '' `` ay , if we can do that , ma'am , '' said elinor , '' we shall do very well with or without colonel brandon . '' and then rising , she went away to join marianne , whom she found , as she expected , in her own room , leaning , in silent misery , over the small remains of a fire , which , till elinor 's entrance , had been her only light . `` you had better leave me , '' was all the notice that her sister received from her . `` i will leave you , '' said elinor , `` if you will go to bed . '' but this , from the momentary perverseness of impatient suffering , she at first refused to do . her sister 's earnest , though gentle persuasion , however , soon softened her to compliance , and elinor saw her lay her aching head on the pillow , and as she hoped , in a way to get some quiet rest before she left her . in the drawing-room , whither she then repaired , she was soon joined by mrs. jennings , with a wine-glass , full of something , in her hand . `` my dear , '' said she , entering , `` i have just recollected that i have some of the finest old constantia wine in the house that ever was tasted , so i have brought a glass of it for your sister . my poor husband ! how fond he was of it ! whenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout , he said it did him more good than any thing else in the world . do take it to your sister . '' `` dear ma'am , '' replied elinor , smiling at the difference of the complaints for which it was recommended , `` how good you are ! but i have just left marianne in bed , and , i hope , almost asleep ; and as i think nothing will be of so much service to her as rest , if you will give me leave , i will drink the wine myself . '' mrs. jennings , though regretting that she had not been five minutes earlier , was satisfied with the compromise ; and elinor , as she swallowed the chief of it , reflected , that though its effects on a colicky gout were , at present , of little importance to her , its healing powers , on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried on herself as on her sister . colonel brandon came in while the party were at tea , and by his manner of looking round the room for marianne , elinor immediately fancied that he neither expected nor wished to see her there , and , in short , that he was already aware of what occasioned her absence . mrs. jennings was not struck by the same thought ; for soon after his entrance , she walked across the room to the tea-table where elinor presided , and whispered -- '' the colonel looks as grave as ever you see . he knows nothing of it ; do tell him , my dear . '' he shortly afterwards drew a chair close to her 's , and , with a look which perfectly assured her of his good information , inquired after her sister . `` marianne is not well , '' said she . `` she has been indisposed all day , and we have persuaded her to go to bed . '' `` perhaps , then , '' he hesitatingly replied , `` what i heard this morning may be -- there may be more truth in it than i could believe possible at first . '' `` what did you hear ? '' `` that a gentleman , whom i had reason to think -- in short , that a man , whom i knew to be engaged -- but how shall i tell you ? if you know it already , as surely you must , i may be spared . '' `` you mean , '' answered elinor , with forced calmness , '' mr. willoughby 's marriage with miss grey . yes , we do know it all . this seems to have been a day of general elucidation , for this very morning first unfolded it to us . mr. willoughby is unfathomable ! where did you hear it ? '' `` in a stationer 's shop in pall mall , where i had business . two ladies were waiting for their carriage , and one of them was giving the other an account of the intended match , in a voice so little attempting concealment , that it was impossible for me not to hear all . the name of willoughby , john willoughby , frequently repeated , first caught my attention ; and what followed was a positive assertion that every thing was now finally settled respecting his marriage with miss grey -- it was no longer to be a secret -- it would take place even within a few weeks , with many particulars of preparations and other matters . one thing , especially , i remember , because it served to identify the man still more : -- as soon as the ceremony was over , they were to go to combe magna , his seat in somersetshire . my astonishment ! -- but it would be impossible to describe what i felt . the communicative lady i learnt , on inquiry , for i stayed in the shop till they were gone , was a mrs. ellison , and that , as i have been since informed , is the name of miss grey 's guardian . '' `` it is . but have you likewise heard that miss grey has fifty thousand pounds ? in that , if in any thing , we may find an explanation . '' `` it may be so ; but willoughby is capable -- at least i think '' -- he stopped a moment ; then added in a voice which seemed to distrust itself , `` and your sister -- how did she -- '' '' her sufferings have been very severe . i have only to hope that they may be proportionately short . it has been , it is a most cruel affliction . till yesterday , i believe , she never doubted his regard ; and even now , perhaps -- but i am almost convinced that he never was really attached to her . he has been very deceitful ! and , in some points , there seems a hardness of heart about him . '' `` ah ! '' said colonel brandon , `` there is , indeed ! but your sister does not -- i think you said so -- she does not consider quite as you do ? '' `` you know her disposition , and may believe how eagerly she would still justify him if she could . '' he made no answer ; and soon afterwards , by the removal of the tea-things , and the arrangement of the card parties , the subject was necessarily dropped . mrs. jennings , who had watched them with pleasure while they were talking , and who expected to see the effect of miss dashwood 's communication , in such an instantaneous gaiety on colonel brandon 's side , as might have become a man in the bloom of youth , of hope and happiness , saw him , with amazement , remain the whole evening more serious and thoughtful than usual . chapter 31 from a night of more sleep than she had expected , marianne awoke the next morning to the same consciousness of misery in which she had closed her eyes . elinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk of what she felt ; and before breakfast was ready , they had gone through the subject again and again ; and with the same steady conviction and affectionate counsel on elinor 's side , the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on marianne 's , as before . sometimes she could believe willoughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself , and at others , lost every consolation in the impossibility of acquitting him . at one moment she was absolutely indifferent to the observation of all the world , at another she would seclude herself from it for ever , and at a third could resist it with energy . in one thing , however , she was uniform , when it came to the point , in avoiding , where it was possible , the presence of mrs. jennings , and in a determined silence when obliged to endure it . her heart was hardened against the belief of mrs. jennings's entering into her sorrows with any compassion . `` no , no , no , it can not be , '' she cried ; '' she can not feel . her kindness is not sympathy ; her good-nature is not tenderness . all that she wants is gossip , and she only likes me now because i supply it . '' elinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice to which her sister was often led in her opinion of others , by the irritable refinement of her own mind , and the too great importance placed by her on the delicacies of a strong sensibility , and the graces of a polished manner . like half the rest of the world , if more than half there be that are clever and good , marianne , with excellent abilities and an excellent disposition , was neither reasonable nor candid . she expected from other people the same opinions and feelings as her own , and she judged of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions on herself . thus a circumstance occurred , while the sisters were together in their own room after breakfast , which sunk the heart of mrs. jennings still lower in her estimation ; because , through her own weakness , it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself , though mrs. jennings was governed in it by an impulse of the utmost goodwill . with a letter in her outstretched hand , and countenance gaily smiling , from the persuasion of bringing comfort , she entered their room , saying , '' now , my dear , i bring you something that i am sure will do you good . '' marianne heard enough . in one moment her imagination placed before her a letter from willoughby , full of tenderness and contrition , explanatory of all that had passed , satisfactory , convincing ; and instantly followed by willoughby himself , rushing eagerly into the room to inforce , at her feet , by the eloquence of his eyes , the assurances of his letter . the work of one moment was destroyed by the next . the hand writing of her mother , never till then unwelcome , was before her ; and , in the acuteness of the disappointment which followed such an ecstasy of more than hope , she felt as if , till that instant , she had never suffered . the cruelty of mrs. jennings no language , within her reach in her moments of happiest eloquence , could have expressed ; and now she could reproach her only by the tears which streamed from her eyes with passionate violence -- a reproach , however , so entirely lost on its object , that after many expressions of pity , she withdrew , still referring her to the letter of comfort . but the letter , when she was calm enough to read it , brought little comfort . willoughby filled every page . her mother , still confident of their engagement , and relying as warmly as ever on his constancy , had only been roused by elinor 's application , to intreat from marianne greater openness towards them both ; and this , with such tenderness towards her , such affection for willoughby , and such a conviction of their future happiness in each other , that she wept with agony through the whole of it . all her impatience to be at home again now returned ; her mother was dearer to her than ever ; dearer through the very excess of her mistaken confidence in willoughby , and she was wildly urgent to be gone . elinor , unable herself to determine whether it were better for marianne to be in london or at barton , offered no counsel of her own except of patience till their mother 's wishes could be known ; and at length she obtained her sister 's consent to wait for that knowledge . mrs. jennings left them earlier than usual ; for she could not be easy till the middletons and palmers were able to grieve as much as herself ; and positively refusing elinor 's offered attendance , went out alone for the rest of the morning . elinor , with a very heavy heart , aware of the pain she was going to communicate , and perceiving , by marianne 's letter , how ill she had succeeded in laying any foundation for it , then sat down to write her mother an account of what had passed , and entreat her directions for the future ; while marianne , who came into the drawing-room on mrs. jennings 's going away , remained fixed at the table where elinor wrote , watching the advancement of her pen , grieving over her for the hardship of such a task , and grieving still more fondly over its effect on her mother . in this manner they had continued about a quarter of an hour , when marianne , whose nerves could not then bear any sudden noise , was startled by a rap at the door . `` who can this be ? '' cried elinor . `` so early too ! i thought we had been safe . '' marianne moved to the window -- '' it is colonel brandon ! '' said she , with vexation . `` we are never safe from him . '' `` he will not come in , as mrs. jennings is from home . '' `` i will not trust to that , '' retreating to her own room . `` a man who has nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on that of others . '' the event proved her conjecture right , though it was founded on injustice and error ; for colonel brandon did come in ; and elinor , who was convinced that solicitude for marianne brought him thither , and who saw that solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look , and in his anxious though brief inquiry after her , could not forgive her sister for esteeming him so lightly . `` i met mrs. jennings in bond street , '' said he , after the first salutation , `` and she encouraged me to come on ; and i was the more easily encouraged , because i thought it probable that i might find you alone , which i was very desirous of doing . my object -- my wish -- my sole wish in desiring it -- i hope , i believe it is -- is to be a means of giving comfort ; -- no , i must not say comfort -- not present comfort -- but conviction , lasting conviction to your sister 's mind . my regard for her , for yourself , for your mother -- will you allow me to prove it , by relating some circumstances which nothing but a very sincere regard -- nothing but an earnest desire of being useful -- i think i am justified -- though where so many hours have been spent in convincing myself that i am right , is there not some reason to fear i may be wrong ? '' he stopped . `` i understand you , '' said elinor . `` you have something to tell me of mr. willoughby , that will open his character farther . your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship that can be shewn marianne . my gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to that end , and hers must be gained by it in time . pray , pray let me hear it . '' `` you shall ; and , to be brief , when i quitted barton last october , -- but this will give you no idea -- i must go farther back . you will find me a very awkward narrator , miss dashwood ; i hardly know where to begin . a short account of myself , i believe , will be necessary , and it shall be a short one . on such a subject , '' sighing heavily , '' can i have little temptation to be diffuse . '' he stopt a moment for recollection , and then , with another sigh , went on . `` you have probably entirely forgotten a conversation -- ( it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression on you ) -- a conversation between us one evening at barton park -- it was the evening of a dance -- in which i alluded to a lady i had once known , as resembling , in some measure , your sister marianne . '' `` indeed , '' answered elinor , `` i have not forgotten it . '' he looked pleased by this remembrance , and added , '' if i am not deceived by the uncertainty , the partiality of tender recollection , there is a very strong resemblance between them , as well in mind as person . the same warmth of heart , the same eagerness of fancy and spirits . this lady was one of my nearest relations , an orphan from her infancy , and under the guardianship of my father . our ages were nearly the same , and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends . i can not remember the time when i did not love eliza ; and my affection for her , as we grew up , was such , as perhaps , judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity , you might think me incapable of having ever felt . her 's , for me , was , i believe , fervent as the attachment of your sister to mr. willoughby and it was , though from a different cause , no less unfortunate . at seventeen she was lost to me for ever . she was married -- married against her inclination to my brother . her fortune was large , and our family estate much encumbered . and this , i fear , is all that can be said for the conduct of one , who was at once her uncle and guardian . my brother did not deserve her ; he did not even love her . i had hoped that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty , and for some time it did ; but at last the misery of her situation , for she experienced great unkindness , overcame all her resolution , and though she had promised me that nothing -- but how blindly i relate ! i have never told you how this was brought on . we were within a few hours of eloping together for scotland . the treachery , or the folly , of my cousin 's maid betrayed us . i was banished to the house of a relation far distant , and she was allowed no liberty , no society , no amusement , till my father 's point was gained . i had depended on her fortitude too far , and the blow was a severe one -- but had her marriage been happy , so young as i then was , a few months must have reconciled me to it , or at least i should not have now to lament it . this however was not the case . my brother had no regard for her ; his pleasures were not what they ought to have been , and from the first he treated her unkindly . the consequence of this , upon a mind so young , so lively , so inexperienced as mrs. brandon 's , was but too natural . she resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation ; and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned . but can we wonder that , with such a husband to provoke inconstancy , and without a friend to advise or restrain her ( for my father lived only a few months after their marriage , and i was with my regiment in the east indies ) she should fall ? had i remained in england , perhaps -- but i meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years , and for that purpose had procured my exchange . the shock which her marriage had given me , '' he continued , in a voice of great agitation , `` was of trifling weight -- was nothing to what i felt when i heard , about two years afterwards , of her divorce . it was that which threw this gloom , -- even now the recollection of what i suffered -- '' he could say no more , and rising hastily walked for a few minutes about the room . elinor , affected by his relation , and still more by his distress , could not speak . he saw her concern , and coming to her , took her hand , pressed it , and kissed it with grateful respect . a few minutes more of silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure . `` it was nearly three years after this unhappy period before i returned to england . my first care , when i did arrive , was of course to seek for her ; but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy . i could not trace her beyond her first seducer , and there was every reason to fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of sin . her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune , nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance , and i learnt from my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months before to another person . he imagined , and calmly could he imagine it , that her extravagance , and consequent distress , had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief . at last , however , and after i had been six months in england , i did find her . regard for a former servant of my own , who had since fallen into misfortune , carried me to visit him in a spunging-house , where he was confined for debt ; and there , the same house , under a similar confinement , was my unfortunate sister . so altered -- so faded -- worn down by acute suffering of every kind ! hardly could i believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me , to be the remains of the lovely , blooming , healthful girl , on whom i had once doted . what i endured in so beholding her -- but i have no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it -- i have pained you too much already . that she was , to all appearance , in the last stage of a consumption , was -- yes , in such a situation it was my greatest comfort . life could do nothing for her , beyond giving time for a better preparation for death ; and\n"

      "and therefore so tediously -- no creature to speak to -- my own reflections so cheerful -- when i looked forward every thing so inviting ! -- when i looked back at barton , the picture so soothing ! -- oh , it was a blessed journey ! '' he stopped . `` well , sir , '' said elinor , who , though pitying him , grew impatient for his departure , `` and this is all ? '' `` ah ! -- no , -- have you forgot what passed in town ? -- that infamous letter -- did she shew it you ? '' `` yes , i saw every note that passed . '' `` when the first of hers reached me ( as it immediately did , for i was in town the whole time , ) what i felt is -- in the common phrase , not to be expressed ; in a more simple one -- perhaps too simple to raise any emotion -- my feelings were very , very painful. -- every line , every word was -- in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer , were she here , would forbid -- a dagger to my heart . to know that marianne was in town was -- in the same language -- a thunderbolt. -- thunderbolts and daggers ! -- what a reproof would she have given me ! -- her taste , her opinions -- i believe they are better known to me than my own , -- and i am sure they are dearer . '' elinor 's heart , which had undergone many changes in the course of this extraordinary conversation , was now softened again ; -- yet she felt it her duty to check such ideas in her companion as the last . `` this is not right , mr . willoughby. -- remember that you are married . relate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me to hear . '' `` marianne 's note , by assuring me that i was still as dear to her as in former days , that in spite of the many , many weeks we had been separated , she was as constant in her own feelings , and as full of faith in the constancy of mine as ever , awakened all my remorse . i say awakened , because time and london , business and dissipation , had in some measure quieted it , and i had been growing a fine hardened villain , fancying myself indifferent to her , and chusing to fancy that she too must have become indifferent to me ; talking to myself of our past attachment as a mere idle , trifling business , shrugging up my shoulders in proof of its being so , and silencing every reproach , overcoming every scruple , by secretly saying now and then , ' i shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married . ' -- but this note made me know myself better . i felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman in the world , and that i was using her infamously . but every thing was then just settled between miss grey and me . to retreat was impossible . all that i had to do , was to avoid you both . i sent no answer to marianne , intending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice ; and for some time i was even determined not to call in berkeley street ; -- but at last , judging it wiser to affect the air of a cool , common acquaintance than anything else , i watched you all safely out of the house one morning , and left my name . '' `` watched us out of the house ! '' `` even so . you would be surprised to hear how often i watched you , how often i was on the point of falling in with you . i have entered many a shop to avoid your sight , as the carriage drove by . lodging as i did in bond street , there was hardly a day in which i did not catch a glimpse of one or other of you ; and nothing but the most constant watchfulness on my side , a most invariably prevailing desire to keep out of your sight , could have separated us so long . i avoided the middletons as much as possible , as well as everybody else who was likely to prove an acquaintance in common . not aware of their being in town , however , i blundered on sir john , i believe , the first day of his coming , and the day after i had called at mrs. jennings 's . he asked me to a party , a dance at his house in the evening. -- had he not told me as an inducement that you and your sister were to be there , i should have felt it too certain a thing , to trust myself near him . the next morning brought another short note from marianne -- still affectionate , open , artless , confiding -- everything that could make my conduct most hateful . i could not answer it . i tried -- but could not frame a sentence . but i thought of her , i believe , every moment of the day . if you can pity me , miss dashwood , pity my situation as it was then . with my head and heart full of your sister , i was forced to play the happy lover to another woman ! -- those three or four weeks were worse than all . well , at last , as i need not tell you , you were forced on me ; and what a sweet figure i cut ! -- what an evening of agony it was ! -- marianne , beautiful as an angel on one side , calling me willoughby in such a tone ! -- oh , god ! -- holding out her hand to me , asking me for an explanation , with those bewitching eyes fixed in such speaking solicitude on my face ! -- and sophia , jealous as the devil on the other hand , looking all that was -- well , it does not signify ; it is over now. -- such an evening ! -- i ran away from you all as soon as i could ; but not before i had seen marianne 's sweet face as white as death. -- that was the last , last look i ever had of her ; -- the last manner in which she appeared to me . it was a horrid sight ! -- yet when i thought of her to-day as really dying , it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that i knew exactly how she would appear to those , who saw her last in this world . she was before me , constantly before me , as i travelled , in the same look and hue . '' a short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded . willoughby first rousing himself , broke it thus : '' well , let me make haste and be gone . your sister is certainly better , certainly out of danger ? '' `` we are assured of it . '' `` your poor mother , too ! -- doting on marianne . '' `` but the letter , mr. willoughby , your own letter ; have you any thing to say about that ? '' `` yes , yes , that in particular . your sister wrote to me again , you know , the very next morning . you saw what she said . i was breakfasting at the ellisons , -- and her letter , with some others , was brought to me there from my lodgings . it happened to catch sophia 's eye before it caught mine -- and its size , the elegance of the paper , the hand-writing altogether , immediately gave her a suspicion . some vague report had reached her before of my attachment to some young lady in devonshire , and what had passed within her observation the preceding evening had marked who the young lady was , and made her more jealous than ever . affecting that air of playfulness , therefore , which is delightful in a woman one loves , she opened the letter directly , and read its contents . she was well paid for her impudence . she read what made her wretched . her wretchedness i could have borne , but her passion -- her malice -- at all events it must be appeased . and , in short -- what do you think of my wife 's style of letter-writing ? -- delicate -- tender -- truly feminine -- was it not ? '' `` your wife ! -- the letter was in your own hand-writing . '' `` yes , but i had only the credit of servilely copying such sentences as i was ashamed to put my name to . the original was all her own -- her own happy thoughts and gentle diction . but what could i do ! -- we were engaged , every thing in preparation , the day almost fixed -- but i am talking like a fool . preparation ! -- day ! -- in honest words , her money was necessary to me , and in a situation like mine , any thing was to be done to prevent a rupture . and after all , what did it signify to my character in the opinion of marianne and her friends , in what language my answer was couched ? -- it must have been only to one end . my business was to declare myself a scoundrel , and whether i did it with a bow or a bluster was of little importance. -- ' i am ruined for ever in their opinion -- ' said i to myself -- ' i am shut out for ever from their society , they already think me an unprincipled fellow , this letter will only make them think me a blackguard one . ' such were my reasonings , as , in a sort of desperate carelessness , i copied my wife 's words , and parted with the last relics of marianne . her three notes -- unluckily they were all in my pocketbook , or i should have denied their existence , and hoarded them for ever -- i was forced to put them up , and could not even kiss them . and the lock of hair -- that too i had always carried about me in the same pocket-book , which was now searched by madam with the most ingratiating virulence , -- the dear lock -- all , every memento was torn from me . '' `` you are very wrong , mr. willoughby , very blamable , '' said elinor , while her voice , in spite of herself , betrayed her compassionate emotion ; `` you ought not to speak in this way , either of mrs. willoughby or my sister . you had made your own choice . it was not forced on you . your wife has a claim to your politeness , to your respect , at least . she must be attached to you , or she would not have married you . to treat her with unkindness , to speak of her slightingly is no atonement to marianne -- nor can i suppose it a relief to your own conscience . '' `` do not talk to me of my wife , '' said he with a heavy sigh. -- '' she does not deserve your compassion. -- she knew i had no regard for her when we married. -- well , married we were , and came down to combe magna to be happy , and afterwards returned to town to be gay. -- and now do you pity me , miss dashwood ? -- or have i said all this to no purpose ? -- am i -- be it only one degree -- am i less guilty in your opinion than i was before ? -- my intentions were not always wrong . have i explained away any part of my guilt ? '' `` yes , you have certainly removed something -- a little. -- you have proved yourself , on the whole , less faulty than i had believed you . you have proved your heart less wicked , much less wicked . but i hardly know -- the misery that you have inflicted -- i hardly know what could have made it worse . '' `` will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered , what i have been telling you ? -- let me be a little lightened too in her opinion as well as in yours . you tell me that she has forgiven me already . let me be able to fancy that a better knowledge of my heart , and of my present feelings , will draw from her a more spontaneous , more natural , more gentle , less dignified , forgiveness . tell her of my misery and my penitence -- tell her that my heart was never inconstant to her , and if you will , that at this moment she is dearer to me than ever . '' `` i will tell her all that is necessary to what may comparatively be called , your justification . but you have not explained to me the particular reason of your coming now , nor how you heard of her illness . '' `` last night , in drury lane lobby , i ran against sir john middleton , and when he saw who i was -- for the first time these two months -- he spoke to me. -- that he had cut me ever since my marriage , i had seen without surprise or resentment . now , however , his good-natured , honest , stupid soul , full of indignation against me , and concern for your sister , could not resist the temptation of telling me what he knew ought to -- though probably he did not think it would -- vex me horridly . as bluntly as he could speak it , therefore , he told me that marianne dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at cleveland -- a letter that morning received from mrs. jennings declared her danger most imminent -- the palmers are all gone off in a fright , & c. -- i was too much shocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the undiscerning sir john . his heart was softened in seeing mine suffer ; and so much of his ill-will was done away , that when we parted , he almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise about a pointer puppy . what i felt on hearing that your sister was dying -- and dying too , believing me the greatest villain upon earth , scorning , hating me in her latest moments -- for how could i tell what horrid projects might not have been imputed ? one person i was sure would represent me as capable of any thing -- what i felt was dreadful ! -- my resolution was soon made , and at eight o'clock this morning i was in my carriage . now you know all . '' elinor made no answer . her thoughts were silently fixed on the irreparable injury which too early an independence and its consequent habits of idleness , dissipation , and luxury , had made in the mind , the character , the happiness , of a man who , to every advantage of person and talents , united a disposition naturally open and honest , and a feeling , affectionate temper . the world had made him extravagant and vain -- extravagance and vanity had made him cold-hearted and selfish . vanity , while seeking its own guilty triumph at the expense of another , had involved him in a real attachment , which extravagance , or at least its offspring , necessity , had required to be sacrificed . each faulty propensity in leading him to evil , had led him likewise to punishment . the attachment , from which against honour , against feeling , against every better interest he had outwardly torn himself , now , when no longer allowable , governed every thought ; and the connection , for the sake of which he had , with little scruple , left her sister to misery , was likely to prove a source of unhappiness to himself of a far more incurable nature . from a reverie of this kind she was recalled at the end of some minutes by willoughby , who , rousing himself from a reverie at least equally painful , started up in preparation for going , and said -- '' there is no use in staying here ; i must be off . '' `` are you going back to town ? '' `` no -- to combe magna . i have business there ; from thence to town in a day or two . good bye . '' he held out his hand . she could not refuse to give him hers 's ; -- he pressed it with affection . `` and you do think something better of me than you did ? '' -- said he , letting it fall , and leaning against the mantel-piece as if forgetting he was to go . elinor assured him that she did ; -- that she forgave , pitied , wished him well -- was even interested in his happiness -- and added some gentle counsel as to the behaviour most likely to promote it . his answer was not very encouraging . `` as to that , '' said he , `` i must rub through the world as well as i can . domestic happiness is out of the question . if , however , i am allowed to think that you and yours feel an interest in my fate and actions , it may be the means -- it may put me on my guard -- at least , it may be something to live for . marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever . were i even by any blessed chance at liberty again -- '' elinor stopped him with a reproof . `` well , '' -- he replied -- '' once more good bye . i shall now go away and live in dread of one event . '' `` what do you mean ? '' `` your sister 's marriage . '' `` you are very wrong . she can never be more lost to you than she is now . '' `` but she will be gained by some one else . and if that some one should be the very he whom , of all others , i could least bear -- but i will not stay to rob myself of all your compassionate goodwill , by shewing that where i have most injured i can least forgive . good bye , -- god bless you ! '' and with these words , he almost ran out of the room . chapter 45 elinor , for some time after he left her , for some time even after the sound of his carriage had died away , remained too much oppressed by a crowd of ideas , widely differing in themselves , but of which sadness was the general result , to think even of her sister . willoughby , he , whom only half an hour ago she had abhorred as the most worthless of men , willoughby , in spite of all his faults , excited a degree of commiseration for the sufferings produced by them , which made her think of him as now separated for ever from her family , with a tenderness , a regret , rather in proportion , as she soon acknowledged within herself -- to his wishes than to his merits . she felt that his influence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason to have weight ; by that person of uncommon attraction , that open , affectionate , and lively manner which it was no merit to possess ; and by that still ardent love for marianne , which it was not even innocent to indulge . but she felt that it was so , long , long before she could feel his influence less . when at last she returned to the unconscious marianne , she found her just awaking , refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of her hopes . elinor 's heart was full . the past , the present , the future , willoughby 's visit , marianne 's safety , and her mother 's expected arrival , threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits which kept off every indication of fatigue , and made her only fearful of betraying herself to her sister . short was the time , however , in which that fear could affect her , for within half an hour after willoughby's leaving the house , she was again called down stairs by the sound of another carriage. -- eager to save her mother from every unnecessary moment 's horrible suspense , she ran immediately into the hall , and reached the outward door just in time to receive and support her as she entered it . mrs. dashwood , whose terror as they drew near the house had produced almost the conviction of marianne's being no more , had no voice to inquire after her , no voice even for elinor ; but she , waiting neither for salutation nor inquiry , instantly gave the joyful relief ; -- and her mother , catching it with all her usual warmth , was in a moment as much overcome by her happiness , as she had been before by her fears . she was supported into the drawing-room between her daughter and her friend ; -- and there , shedding tears of joy , though still unable to speak , embraced elinor again and again , turning from her at intervals to press colonel brandon 's hand , with a look which spoke at once her gratitude , and her conviction of his sharing with herself in the bliss of the moment . he shared it , however , in a silence even greater than her own . as soon as mrs. dashwood had recovered herself , to see marianne was her first desire ; and in two minutes she was with her beloved child , rendered dearer to her than ever by absence , unhappiness , and danger . elinor 's delight , as she saw what each felt in the meeting , was only checked by an apprehension of its robbing marianne of farther sleep ; -- but mrs. dashwood could be calm , could be even prudent , when the life of a child was at stake , and marianne , satisfied in knowing her mother was near her , and conscious of being too weak for conversation , submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by every nurse around her . mrs. dashwood would sit up with her all night ; and elinor , in compliance with her mother 's entreaty , went to bed . but the rest , which one night entirely sleepless , and many hours of the most wearing anxiety seemed to make requisite , was kept off by irritation of spirits . willoughby , `` poor willoughby , '' as she now allowed herself to call him , was constantly in her thoughts ; she would not but have heard his vindication for the world , and now blamed , now acquitted herself for having judged him so harshly before . but her promise of relating it to her sister was invariably painful . she dreaded the performance of it , dreaded what its effect on marianne might be ; doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever be happy with another ; and for a moment wished willoughby a widower . then , remembering colonel brandon , reproved herself , felt that to his sufferings and his constancy far more than to his rival 's , the reward of her sister was due , and wished any thing rather than mrs. willoughby 's death . the shock of colonel brandon 's errand at barton had been much softened to mrs. dashwood by her own previous alarm ; for so great was her uneasiness about marianne , that she had already determined to set out for cleveland on that very day , without waiting for any further intelligence , and had so far settled her journey before his arrival , that the careys were then expected every moment to fetch margaret away , as her mother was unwilling to take her where there might be infection . marianne continued to mend every day , and the brilliant cheerfulness of mrs. dashwood 's looks and spirits proved her to be , as she repeatedly declared herself , one of the happiest women in the world . elinor could not hear the declaration , nor witness its proofs without sometimes wondering whether her mother ever recollected edward . but mrs. dashwood , trusting to the temperate account of her own disappointment which elinor had sent her , was led away by the exuberance of her joy to think only of what would increase it . marianne was restored to her from a danger in which , as she now began to feel , her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate attachment to willoughby , had contributed to place her ; -- and in her recovery she had yet another source of joy unthought of by elinor . it was thus imparted to her , as soon as any opportunity of private conference between them occurred . `` at last we are alone . my elinor , you do not yet know all my happiness . colonel brandon loves marianne . he has told me so himself . '' her daughter , feeling by turns both pleased and pained , surprised and not surprised , was all silent attention . `` you are never like me , dear elinor , or i should wonder at your composure now . had i sat down to wish for any possible good to my family , i should have fixed on colonel brandon 's marrying one of you as the object most desirable . and i believe marianne will be the most happy with him of the two . '' elinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so , because satisfied that none founded on an impartial consideration of their age , characters , or feelings , could be given ; -- but her mother must always be carried away by her imagination on any interesting subject , and therefore instead of an inquiry , she passed it off with a smile . `` he opened his whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled . it came out quite unawares , quite undesignedly . i , you may well believe , could talk of nothing but my child ; -- he could not conceal his distress ; i saw that it equalled my own , and he perhaps , thinking that mere friendship , as the world now goes , would not justify so warm a sympathy -- or rather , not thinking at all , i suppose -- giving way to irresistible feelings , made me acquainted with his earnest , tender , constant , affection for marianne . he has loved her , my elinor , ever since the first moment of seeing her . '' here , however , elinor perceived , -- not the language , not the professions of colonel brandon , but the natural embellishments of her mother 's active fancy , which fashioned every thing delightful to her as it chose . `` his regard for her , infinitely surpassing anything that willoughby ever felt or feigned , as much more warm , as more sincere or constant -- which ever we are to call it -- has subsisted through all the knowledge of dear marianne's unhappy prepossession for that worthless young man ! -- and without selfishness -- without encouraging a hope ! -- could he have seen her happy with another -- such a noble mind ! -- such openness , such sincerity ! -- no one can be deceived in him . '' `` colonel brandon 's character , '' said elinor , '' as an excellent man , is well established . '' `` i know it is '' -- replied her mother seriously , `` or after such a warning , i should be the last to encourage such affection , or even to be pleased by it . but his coming for me as he did , with such active , such ready friendship , is enough to prove him one of\n"
