    "- You should work alone.\n",
    "- You may look up any information you want (including re-using code from the labs or lectures), but don't copy-paste code without understanding it.\n",
    "- You should only use Python concepts that have been covered in the course slides and notebooks. (Note: The book contains some concepts that have NOT been covered; don't use those).\n",
    "- Partial credit will be assigned. Try to get as far as you can even if you cannot completely solve a problem.\n",
    "- Your solutions are graded for:\n",
    "  - whether your code works correctly in all cases,\n",
    "  - whether your accompanying explanation of the code is complete and correct,\n",
    "  - code style:\n",
    "    - meaningful variable names\n",

    "## 3. Penguins (3 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "After successfully uncovering the spy operation and impressing your government with your analysis of the US presidential elections, as a reward you are sent to Antarctica to study penguins. Your mission is to settle long standing questions on sex differences in penguins. You have collected data in a table (given as a string in the cell below, run it before proceeding), and are asked to summarize the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The table has the following columns (prefixed by the column number starting from 0):\n",
    "\n",
    "0. `species/island` (str)\n",
    "1. `bill_length_mm` (float)\n",
    "2. `bill_depth_mm` (float)\n",
    "3. `flipper_length_mm` (float)\n",
    "4. `body_mass_g` (float)\n",
    "5. `sex` (str)\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Write a function `analyze(data, column_number)` that goes through the table and computes the mean of the numbers in the specified column. Your function only has to work for the numeric (float) columns. Calculate the mean by summing the numbers, and then dividing by the number of penguins. Since your research question involves sex differences, compute the mean for males and females separately and return both numbers in a dictionary. Some data is missing, indicated with the value `'NA'`. Skip those lines/penguins/measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    " - Go through the table line by line. Split it into lines with the method [splitlines()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.splitlines) which returns a list.\n",
    " - The table is in a tab-separated format (Jupyter displays the tab characters with a special arrow symbol). Given a line of the table, split the line into a list with `line.split('\\t')`.\n",
    " - `analyze(data, 3)` should return the means for column 3 (starting from 0), i.e., `flipper_length_mm` in this dataset. Again, your code only has to work for the float columns.\n",
    " - The code should return a dictionary of the form\n",
    "   `{'male': 181.2, 'female': 177.4}` (these numbers are just examples)\n",
